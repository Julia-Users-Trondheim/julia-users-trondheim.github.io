# Julia Users Trondheim

## We just started

Let's collect ideas together at [this collaborative Markdown document](https://md.chaotikum.org/uRl4Oov0RnSrPdbaqfuohw?both). If you would even like to help develop this page into something nicer – let me ([@kellertuer](https://github.com/kellertuer)) know – I can easily add you to the [GitHub organisation](). It is currently a plain Franklin.jl template.

## Upcoming Meeting

*15.10.2024* At 18.00 we meet in [G1](https://link.mazemap.com/EQko3UDJ) n the Gløshaugen Campus of NTNU to have some lightning talks. Everyone is invited to contribute a 5-10 minute talk about anything they do in Julia. Feel free to sent the slides upfront already to [Ronny](https://www.ntnu.edu/employees/ronny.bergmann).
The venue is easy to reach, take either bus line 3 (to Lohove) or 22 (to Othilienborg/Vestlia) and get off at “[Gløshaugen](https://atb.travelplanner.no/scripts/TravelMagic/TravelMagicWE.dll/svar?dep1=1&from=Gløshaugen+(Trondheim)&direction=1&date=04.10.2024&time=09%3A44&changepenalty=1&changepause=0&through=&throughpause=&lang=no&referrer=www.atb.no)”. Then the Geologi - building is just on the other side of the street the bus stop, so turn left to find its entrance. If the door is locked, the room has its windows at the same side as the entrance on ground floor.
