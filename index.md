# Julia Users Trondheim

## We just started

Let's collect ideas together at [this collaborative Markdown document](https://md.chaotikum.org/uRl4Oov0RnSrPdbaqfuohw?both). If you would even like to help develop this page into something nicer – let me ([@kellertuer](https://github.com/kellertuer)) know – I can easily add you to the [GitHub organisation](). It is currently a plain Franklin.jl template.

## Upcoming Meeting

Until now there is upcoming meeting planned, but as soon as we find enough people, I am happy to take care about arranging a date and check for a nice room at NTNU.
