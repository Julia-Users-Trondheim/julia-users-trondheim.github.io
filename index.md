# Julia Users Trondheim

## We just started

Let's collect ideas together at [this collaborative Markdown document](https://md.chaotikum.org/uRl4Oov0RnSrPdbaqfuohw?both). If you would even like to help develop this page into something nicer – let me ([@kellertuer](https://github.com/kellertuer)) know – I can easily add you to the [GitHub organisation](). It is currently a plain Franklin.jl template.

## Upcoming Meeting

*15.10.2024* At 18.00 we meet in [G1](https://link.mazemap.com/EQko3UDJ) n the Gløshaugen Campus of NTNU to have some lightning talks. Everyone is invited to contribute a 5-10 minute talk about anything they do in Julia. Feel free to sent the slides upfront already to [Ronny](https://www.ntnu.edu/employees/ronny.bergmann).
